					</header>
					<p> I'm 24 years old engineer and entrepreneur, born and raised in Panama City, Panama. I'm always trying to learn something new: currently learning
					to code. My favourite things are: beach, boxing, cooking, eating and travelling. Visionary, assertive, passionate, decision maker, driven, team builder, oriented
					in great customer experience, persistent, flexible to adaptation, openness to feedback, able to get people on board that have to add to the vision, and open minded
					when there's a more efficient way to do something.</p>
					<br/>
					<p> On my junior year of high school, I had the opportunity to participate in a contest for Young Entrepreneurs sponsored by Junior Achievement Worldwide. 
					My school had won nine years in a row and in that year we won for the tenth time. I was chosen as a Young Entrepreneur within my company. I was able to go 
					to the International Forum for Entrepreneurs (FIE) in Mexico and after that to the version in Guatemala. A year after that, I started to create my own women's 
					accessories handmade line in order to generate extra income for my senior year. By the time I started to attend to college, the project pivoted. Now I'm the founder 
					of a clothing startup <a href= "http://www.crushbyac.com"> Crush by AC</a>: a swimwear and active-wear clothing brand made in Panama. </p>
					<br/>
					<p> When I was finishing my major in Industrial Engineering and Management, I began get immersed in my city's entrepreneurial culture by attending
					to meet-ups, workshops, etc. I've been earning by doing.  As I saw the lack of structure for new entrepreneurs, because entrepreneurship it's a new thing here,
					I founded a movement called <a href="http://www.fb.com/cookingideaspty"> Cooking Ideas PTY</a>: entrepreneurship and collaboration over a meal. Cooking Ideas are 
					monthly meet-ups targeted to entrepreneurs or wantpreneurs who want to take action on their ideas by sharing some food and drinks.</p>
					<br/>
					<p> I love to "share the good vibes", meaning that everything I get the opportunity to learn, I like to share it with people who gets interested. 
					Aside from my own venture, helping others makes me happy. I want to share my stories and learnings with other entrepreneurs of my city so the can execute their ideas 
					more efficiently. As I dream with a full blown e-commerce platform to boost Crush's sales worldwide, I know that there are many others who have many ideas that just 
					need guidance to move forward. So my mid-term goal is to build my own tech startups, be a mentor, advisor or coach, and hopefully be able to invest in others people's ideas.
