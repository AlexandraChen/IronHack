					</header>
					<p>	I’ve learned that we have to share what we believe is a good idea, because people will tell you if it actually isn’t that good. “I’m afraid to tell my ideas because someone will steal them from me.” “If I say something, they will copy me!”. These are just a few phrases I’ve heard as I get more involved in the entrepreneurship culture and building ideas. Ideas are worthless if not shared or executed.</p>
					<br>

					<p>Of course, you have to be sure what to say and to whom. We have to find a way to be able to share our ideas (without sharing your secret ingredient!) to get objective feedback from people, your early adopters! In the event that people don’t think your idea is good, you won’t have lost that much or you will come back with a better one. How many people do you know that have fallen in love with an idea and for lack of feedback, have lost more than they had? It’s okay to fear telling ideas when we are starting out in the entrepreneurial culture, but once you are more immersed on being “lean” and “agile”, you will realize that feedback is a really important part in the development of our ideas. Nobody wants to develop something that no one would buy or use! </p>
					<br>

					<p>It seems a little bit idealistic, but I’m a truly believer that YOU are the secret ingredient for your ideas, no one can build them like you can! Businesses, startups or projects aren’t just ideas, but people with abilities to solve problems that arise on their given industry. Nowadays not every idea is purely original but rather a mix of experiences, people and things we have seen along the way. You make the difference. If you still think that your idea is so unique, original or innovative that it’s so easy to copy, don’t you think you have a bigger problem?</p>
